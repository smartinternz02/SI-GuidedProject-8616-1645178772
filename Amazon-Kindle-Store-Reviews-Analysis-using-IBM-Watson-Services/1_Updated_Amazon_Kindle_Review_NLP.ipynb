First discovery comes because Trace is writing a fictional book about some of the events without understanding what it is all about.  Or is it fiction?  Events become intense as she and Boomer begin to realize the country may be in peril.Bob Mayer has created a compelling plot with characters that are mostly 3-dimensional and situations that are believable.  This is a story of conspiracy and of doing that which is necesaary even though it smacks of evil.  The ending is satisfying, at least to me.  But what would you do?  There is a wealth of descriptive material, especially about military capabilities, that add to the story.  This is a gripping novel of suspense, political and military type action with a twist of morality.  This is a work of fiction, but in our time could something like this happen or is it too far out?  Reviewed by the author of The Children's Story, A Novel Not for Children (about good and evil).\",\n",

       "       \"This book has a rather farfetched, but interesting premise...that a group of West Pointers going back over a hundred years are secretly controlling the world.  Could have been fun, but the author seems to have strung together a number of separately written sections, while forgetting what happened in the previous sections!  Its nuts, i.e. characters show up injured but no injury was ever described, characters jump from one location to another with no connection, and there seems to be no point to any of it.Very poor writing, even worse editing (does this author even have an editor?).  Mayer needs to clean up his writing, and get it edited.  In addition, his plot is rather thin, and if he's going to go for the outlandish, at least make it a little believable.But my biggest complaint about the book is that it isn't even exciting or particularly interesting. This is no thriller, in fact it drags along so slowly, and fails to grip the reader to such a degree it is actually quite boring and laborious to plod through.Update: After reading the book, the ending was fairly good and some action sequences just prior to the ending were't so bad. So, I'm upgrading the book from one star and making it two stars.  All of my previous comments stand, and Mayer will hopefully turn out something better next time.\"],\n",
